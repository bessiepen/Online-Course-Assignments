## Assignment

- [part1](part1.html) - a simple game which uses a loop with no feedback
- [part2](part2.html) - a complete game with feedback such as "your answer is alphabetically higher than me!".

**note**: part2 is the last version.

## Code tips

```js
//array
var array = ["item1", "item2", "item3"];
array[0];
array.length;
array.indexOf(item);
array.sort();

//math
var variable = Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)

//style
variable.style.background = black;

//while loop
while (!finished) {
    some code;
    finished = true;
}

//decision
function check() {
    if (condition) {
        some code;
        return false;
    }
    if (condition) {
        some code;
        return false;
    }
    some code;
    return true;
}

// timer event
setTimeout(function(){},1000);
```
